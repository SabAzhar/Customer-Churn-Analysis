# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior in a telecom dataset using Python. The aim is to uncover key patterns that can help improve customer retention strategies.

## 📌 Key Insights

- 🧮 **26.54%** of customers have churned, as shown in the churn distribution pie chart.
- 📉 **Higher churn rates** are observed among:
  - Customers on **month-to-month contracts**
  - Users paying via **electronic check**
  - Customers using **fiber optic internet**
  - **Senior citizens**, compared to other age groups
  - Customers **without internet services**
- 🛡️ **Customers who stay** typically:
  - Use **PhoneService**, **DSL InternetService**, and **OnlineSecurity**
  - Have **long-term contracts** (1 or 2 years)
- ⚠️ **Higher churn is seen when**:
  - **OnlineBackup**, **TechSupport**, or **StreamingTV** are **not used** or **unavailable**

These findings can help telecom companies **target at-risk customers** and build more effective **customer engagement strategies**.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Excel


## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains 7,043 customer records with features like contract type, payment method, tenure, and service usage.

## 📸 Visualizations
- Churn distribution (count & pie chart)
- Churn by gender, senior citizen status, and contract type
- Service-based churn comparisons (OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, etc.)
- Payment method vs churn
- Tenure and churn relationship


## 📌 Conclusion
This analysis provides a foundation for predicting churn and retaining valuable customers using data-driven strategies.
